Notes and next steps:
- If you want hyper‑targeted placements (e.g., geography, niche like “tech founders” or “women in leadership”), share the niche and location and I’ll rerun the scan for roundup refreshes and industry editors currently updating pages.
- For each target above, I can draft a 2–3 sentence pitch line and a short bio optimized for inclusion (natural anchor text; compliance‑safe).
