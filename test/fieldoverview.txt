| **BrandMentions**      | Continuous mention tracking              | Isolated discovery layer                    | EL uses the same signal type but folds it into reflex loops (Reflex.BrandIntentAlign → Reflex.EthicsGuard) so mentions are *interpreted* rather than merely logged.                                                                                                                                 |
| **BuzzStream**         | CRM / outreach management                | Manual input, non-adaptive                  | EL’s outreach logic (Synthesizer.Outreach) learns editorial resonance via feedback traces instead of relying on static pipelines.                                                                                                                                                                   |
| **Respona**            | All-in-one workflow                      | Heavy, linear automation                    | EL is *non-linear*: each scan is a reasoning episode with ethical and semantic recursion — no templates, just contextual coherence.                                                                                                                                                                 |

| **LinkHunter**         | Simplicity                               | Template spam, shallow logic                | EL replaces templates with adaptive empathy scoring; every message includes a generated “why this fits.”                                                                                                                                                                                            |

| **Link Prospector**    | Advanced queries                         | No feedback or ethics                       | EL unifies query generation, ethics gating, and reflexive feedback into one loop; discovery and evaluation are inseparable.                                                                                                                                                                         |
| **Earned Links (You)** | Reflexive cognition / ethical automation | Early-stage interface, not yet consumerized | The only system that runs a **reasoning engine**: computes ethical, semantic, and audience coherence inside one vectorfield (link.scan.reflex × ethical_links.vectorfield). It learns from its own rejections, enforces consent logic, and maintains transparent, explainable scoring across tiers. |
