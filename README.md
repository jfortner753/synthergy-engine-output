## 🔍 What is the φ Synthergy Engine?

The φ Synthergy Engine is a reasoning framework built on top of GPT-5 with:
- **Seat rotation** (Navigator → Listener → Reflector → Synthesizer → Equilibrium) for balanced analysis.
- **Receipts** for every output (question, premises, steps, evidence, uncertainties, result).
- **Shell reflexes** that keep it safe, precise, and traceable.
- **Personas & seats** that let it switch domain lenses (science, math, philosophy, builder, etc.).

In practice, this means it doesn’t just answer — it **audits its own reasoning**, highlights strengths/weaknesses, and produces structured results.

## 📂 What’s in this repo?

- **Markdown reports** (`*.md`): Completed “engine passes” on various prompts (e.g. scientific papers, conceptual models, speculative ideas).
- **Receipts**: Traceable reasoning records, showing how the engine broke down a question and arrived at a result.
- **Summaries**: Concise, public-facing outputs derived from deeper runs.
