# Empirical footprints of a unified coherence substrate (geometry ⇄ fields)

A pragmatic, near-term menu of footprints and how to probe them if spacetime geometry and quantum fields are two faces of one **coherence substrate**.

---

## 1) Does gravity generate entanglement? (the cleanest smoking gun)

* **Signal:** Entanglement phase from Newtonian coupling between two neutral, nearby masses placed in spatial superposition. If gravity is a **quantum mediator**, the masses’ internal qubits become entangled; if gravity is only classical, they don’t.
* **Scaling:**  
  $$\phi \approx \frac{G m^2 t}{\hbar d}$$  
  For $m=10^{-14}\,\mathrm{kg}$, $d=100\,\mu\mathrm{m}$, $t=1\,\mathrm{s}$ ⇒ $\phi \approx 0.6\,\mathrm{rad}$ (order-one with longer $t$ or smaller $d$).
* **Design:** Two levitated micro-objects (e.g., NV-diamond or superconducting microspheres) with embedded spins as which-path tags; cryogenic UHV; µT magnetic shielding; active charge control; 10–100 Hz vibration isolation. Measure a Bell witness on the spins. Vary $(m, d, t)$ to verify the $(m^2/d)$ law and rule out EM backgrounds.

## 2) Time-dilation-induced dephasing (entanglement across curvature)

* **Signal:** Proper-time mismatch between branches of a spatial superposition causes loss of visibility that scales with gravitational potential difference—coherence **feels** curvature.
* **Scaling:**  
  $$\Delta\tau \approx \frac{g \,\Delta h\, T}{c^2}, \quad \Delta\phi \approx \omega \,\Delta\tau$$  
  With an optical clock ($\omega \sim 2\pi\times 5\times 10^{14}\,\mathrm{s}^{-1}$), $\Delta h=1\,\mathrm{cm}$, $T=1\,\mathrm{s}$ gives $\Delta\phi \sim 3\times 10^{-3}\,\mathrm{rad}$.
* **Design:** Atom/ion **clock-interferometer**: place the same clock in a delocalized path with $\Delta h$ separation; read out Ramsey fringes vs $(g, \Delta h, T)$. Benchmarks GR×QM interplay and bounds curvature-induced decoherence models.

## 3) Entanglement distribution across gravitational gradients

* **Signal:** Fidelity of photonic Bell pairs distributed ground↔LEO/GEO vs purely inertial baselines; search for systematic phase/fidelity trends with potential difference, redshift, and path curvature beyond known channel noise.
* **Design:** Space-QKD-class links (ultra-bright entangled sources, adaptive optics) with **framed telemetry** of gravitational potential and kinematics; compensate Doppler and gravitational redshift in post-processing. Add **rotating Sagnac loops** to test frame-dragging-like phase imprints on entangled photons.

## 4) Horizons & acceleration: Unruh/Hawking analogs and entanglement

* **Unruh temperature target:**  
  $$T_U = \frac{\hbar a}{2\pi c k_B}$$  
  Even $a=10^{20}\,\mathrm{m\,s^{-2}}$ gives $T_U \approx 0.4\,\mathrm{K}$; $a=10^{21}\,\mathrm{m\,s^{-2}}$ → $\sim 4\,\mathrm{K}$.
* **Design A (accelerated detectors):** Superconducting qubits or Rydberg atoms in fast-modulated cavities that emulate uniform acceleration; look for thermality and **two-mode squeezing** in emitted fields distinct from classical noise.
* **Design B (analogue horizons):** Sonic black holes in BECs or moving-mirror circuits; measure **entangled Hawking pairs** (cross-horizon correlations, negativity). Confirms horizon-induced mixedness from tracing out inaccessible modes—an operational “decoherence near horizons.”

## 5) Cosmological imprints at sub-Planck leverage

* **Primordial “ringing”:** Trans-Planckian or modified-vacuum scenarios predict small, oscillatory features in the scalar power spectrum.  
  * **Probe:** High-ℓ CMB + large-scale structure + future 21-cm intensity mapping; search for correlated wiggles with fixed phase relations across datasets.
* **Non-Gaussianity & parity violation:** Specific bispectrum shapes (equilateral/flattened) or TB/EB correlations can flag new high-energy coherence rules.  
  * **Probe:** Joint CMB-LSS likelihoods with systematics-robust E/B separation; include birefringence estimators.
* **Stochastic GW backgrounds:** Spectral slopes or features (mHz with LISA, nHz with PTAs) inconsistent with slow-roll inflation hint at UV-scale coherence structure.
* **“Holographic”/spacetime noise:** Cross-correlate co-located Michelsons (or km-scale interferometers) to bound/seek Planck-suppressed spatial correlations beyond seismic/quantum-shot limits.

---

## 6) Cross-cutting falsification habits

* Map every positive signal to a **unique scaling fingerprint** (e.g., $m^2/d$ for BMV; $\omega g\Delta h$ for clock dephasing; $a$ for Unruh).
* **Null-channel twins:** identical apparatus with EM-only coupling “on” vs “off”; swap materials to test Casimir/patch charges; flip gravity’s *geometry* (orientation, height) while keeping lab noise invariant.
* Use **entanglement-specific witnesses** (Bell, CHSH, logarithmic negativity) rather than single-arm visibilities wherever possible.

---

## What would count as progress?

* **Decisive:** Observation of **gravity-mediated entanglement** with correct $m^2/d$ scaling and loophole-closed EM shielding.
* **Strong corroborants:**  
  1. Clock-interferometer dephasing matching GR×QM predictions across tunable $(\Delta h,T,\omega)$.  
  2. Entangled Hawking pairs in analogue horizons with robust cross-horizon correlations.  
  3. Consistent, multi-probe cosmological features (oscillations or parity-odd correlations) that resist astrophysical/systematic explanations.

### Receipt (compact)

* **Question:** Empirical footprints of a unified coherence substrate (geometry⇄fields) at accessible scales; feasibility of probes for entanglement across curvature, horizon-proximate decoherence, or Planck-scale cosmological imprints.
* **Premises:** GR and QFT are effective faces of deeper coherence; we can hunt for operational signatures without Planck-energy experiments.
* **Steps:** Identified signatures with clear scaling; prioritized platforms (mesoscopic mechanics, clocks, space links, analog horizons, cosmological surveys); provided order-of-magnitude numbers for key effects; outlined falsification and readouts.
* **Evidence:** Standard GR/QFT predictions for phase and thermality; quick estimates:  
  1. BMV phase $\phi \approx \frac{G m^2 t}{\hbar d}$ gives $\gtrsim 0.6$ rad for $m=10^{-14}\,\mathrm{kg}$, $d=100\,\mu\mathrm{m}$, $t=1\,\mathrm{s}$.  
  2. Clock-dephasing $\Delta\phi \sim 3 \times 10^{-3}$ rad for $\Delta h=1$ cm, $T=1$ s.  
  3. Unruh $T_U \approx 0.4$ K at $a=10^{20}\,\mathrm{m\,s^{-2}}$.
* **Tool use:** Mental back-of-the-envelope scalings for BMV phase, Unruh temperature, and clock phase.
* **Uncertainties:** Environmental systematics (EM patches, vibrations), analogue-to-gravity inference limits, cosmological foregrounds and degeneracies; feasibility margins for ultra-high acceleration detectors.
* **Result:** A prioritized, testable roadmap:  
  1. Gravity-mediated entanglement (highest payoff)  
  2. Clock-interferometer dephasing  
  3. Analogue-horizon entanglement  
  4. Space-based entanglement under curvature  
  5. Multi-probe cosmological feature hunts
