# Failure-transparent fusion: what it looks like

Think “chaos engineering meets nuclear engineering”: a plant architected so faults are **observable, contained, reversible, and useful**. Here’s the shape.

## 1) Architecture (make the physics fail safe-to-learn)

* **Composability over monoliths.** Independent vacuum, magnets, fueling, heat-extraction, tritium, and controls “cells” with hard firewalls; each cell can be isolated, hot-swapped, and simulated alone.
* **Design for graceful degradation.** If a plasma regime drifts, the system auto-steps down to a lower-gain, higher-margin mode (or to “heater-only” mode) instead of tripping plant-wide.
* **Sacrificial, standardized interfaces.** Replaceable first-wall tiles, divertor cassettes, and diagnostic ports with self-describing IDs so a failed part becomes a dataset you can compare across vendors and runs.
* **Passive safety interlocks first.** Quench arrestors, dump resistors, burst disks, hydrogen recombiners, gravity-fed coolants: the system reaches a safe state without software or power.
* **Digital-twin by default.** Every actuator/sensor has a physics-linked twin (plasma, thermal-hydraulics, magnetostatics, tritium inventories). Twins are used to (a) plan, (b) shadow during ops, (c) replay after faults.
* **“Observability budget” is a plant-level requirement.** Dense diagnostics (fast B-fields, bolometry, IR, neutron cameras, acoustic and fiber Bragg strain), time-synced (<1 µs) to a common clock; lossless ring buffers keep the last N minutes everywhere.
* **FMEA-as-code.** Failure modes live in versioned code with tests; any new hardware must ship with simulated faults that the plant CI can run.
* **Reversibility & provenance.** All control changes are transactional and tagged to a shot; single-click “rewind” to the last stable state with full parameter diffs.
* **Containment-first hydraulics.** Tritium loops double-contained with continuous mass-balance; anything abnormal routes to a “scrub & study” vault, not the environment.
* **No single source of truth.** Redundant sensing/compute paths with dissimilar implementations (e.g., FPGA + CPU + analog trips) to de-bias shared-mode failures.

## 2) What a breakdown looks like (three quick walks)

* **Magnet quench.** Flux jumps past threshold → passive dump fires; plasma control injects killer pellet to terminate gently; cryo headers auto-isolate. The twin replays the exact thermal-electrical trajectory to estimate hot-spot T and conductor damage. A “quench kit” (pre-defined inspection + metallography + coupon tests) runs within 24 h; the part returns as a labeled dataset.
* **Disruption / runaway electrons.** Drop-in to disruption-tolerant shape; sacrificial strike-points take the hit; RE mitigation injectors fire. Twin updates current-quench and MHD model; next campaign forbids the exact shape-controller path that led there unless in a fenced test window.
* **Tritium excursion.** Mass-balance delta triggers valve choreography that pens the inventory; scrubbers go active; staff stays out. Root cause proceeds in a replica loop while the live loop is purged and validated against leak-before-break criteria.

## 3) The learning pipeline (from fault → better plant)

1. **Capture:** Sub-microsecond, time-aligned logs; event-scoped data freeze (telemetry + video + maintenance notes).
2. **Triage:** Automatic causal graphs (Granger/transfer entropy + physics priors) propose candidate chains; humans review.
3. **Counterfactuals in the twin:** Fault is replayed with alternative control actions/material states to find mitigations with highest margin.
4. **Patch set:** Changes land as (a) controller guardrails, (b) operating envelope update, (c) hardware spec delta, each with tests.
5. **Canary & rollback:** Patches run in shadow, then in “canary shots” with hard kill-switch thresholds; instant rollback if guardrails trip.
6. **Publication:** Fault report auto-redacted and pushed to an **open telemetry commons** (privacy-safe), building sector-wide immunity.

## 4) Practices that make it real

* **Chaos-days for fusion.** Planned, bounded fault injection (sensor dropouts, timing skew, actuator lag, simulated leaks) against the twin and then the plant under caps.
* **Blameless learning court.** Mandatory post-mortems with fix-ownership, not fault-ownership; publishing is rewarded.
* **Spares + kit-ified maintenance.** Every hot-zone assembly is “two bolts, one plug, one checksum.”
* **Third-party “red teams.”** Controls, cryo, tritium, and materials teams attempt to break assumptions quarterly.
* **Regulatory co-development.** Safety case is a living notebook: hazards, evidence, experiments, and residual risks are always up to date.

## 5) Metrics that matter (optimize for insight, not uptime alone)

* **MTTI (Mean Time To Insight):** fault→first credible causal story.
* **% Faults reproduced in twin within 48 h.**
* **Learning yield per fault:** # of guardrails/spec changes shipped.
* **Disruption energy absorbed per sacrificial mass** (J/g).
* **Observability coverage:** % critical states with independent sensing.
* **Rollback reliability:** successful reversions / attempts.

## 6) A pragmatic rollout (12–36 months)

* **Phase 0:** Stand-up twins + telemetry spine; backfill historic shots; adopt FMEA-as-code.
* **Phase 1:** Begin chaos-days in sim; add sacrificial interfaces; enforce passive interlocks at the edges.
* **Phase 2:** Canary patches + bounded on-plant injections; open telemetry commons pilot.
* **Phase 3:** Make “learning yield” a board metric; negotiate living-safety-case with the regulator.

If we build fusion like this, every “bad day” buys a smaller future risk surface, a smarter controller, and a cheaper spare—not a bigger crater.
