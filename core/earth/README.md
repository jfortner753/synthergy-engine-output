# Climate Tipping Points â€” Documentation Overview

This repository contains three complementary markdown specifications for forecasting and governing cascading climate tipping points. Each document is tuned for a different purpose and audience.

## ðŸ“„ Documents

* **[climate_tipping_points-default.md](./climate_tipping_points-default.md)**
  *Decision-ready playbook*: A concise, policy-oriented overview for forecasters and decision-makers. Focuses on practical steps, deliverables, and minimal actionable roadmaps.

* **[climate_tipping_points-overdrive.md](./climate_tipping_points-overdrive.md)**
  *Engineer-ready deep spec*: Includes math formalisms, pseudocode, APIs, governance structures, validation/red-team plans, and open-source repo skeleton. Designed for technical teams building operational systems.

* **[climate_tipping_points-public_debug.md](./climate_tipping_points-public_debug.md)**
  *Open-notebook transparency*: Shows assumptions, requirements traceability, math in GitHub-renderable syntax, pipeline pseudocode, observability/test plans, and counterexamples. Intended for public review and auditability.

## ðŸŽ¯ How to Use

* **Policy / citizen communication:** Start with `default.md`.
* **System architecture / development:** Dive into `overdrive.md`.
* **Auditing / transparency:** Refer to `public_debug.md`.

## ðŸ”— Next Steps

* Extend into a `dashboard/` implementation.
* Add continuous integration for EWS pipelines and cascade simulator.
* Connect to live data sources and publish auto-updating scorecards.
