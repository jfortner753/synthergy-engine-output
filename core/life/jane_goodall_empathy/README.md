# The 4 Generations Experiment

**Purpose**
A field blueprint for transmitting ecological empathy across four human generations so each inherits **guardianship, not guilt**. Dedicated to Dr Jane Goodall (1934–2025).

## Files in this folder

* **[jane_goodall_empathy-overdrive.md](./jane_goodall_empathy-overdrive.md)** — *Overdrive edition*: adds engine trace (seat rotation), counterexamples/stress tests, falsifiables, a “laughter lock,” and appendices (GOI mini‑bank, power scaffold, data architecture, ceremony scripts).
* **[jane_goodall_empathy-public_debug.md](./jane_goodall_empathy-public_debug.md)** — *Public‑debug edition*: includes tool‑use ledger, deltas vs overdrive, explicit uncertainty bounds, MDE/power sensitivity, audit checklist, risk matrix, and reproducibility hooks.

## Which one should I use?

* **default** → sharing with stakeholders, quick onboarding.
* **overdrive** → program design, implementation planning, reviewer Q&A.
* **public_debug** → transparency with partners, governance boards, open‑science artifacts.

## Quick start

1. Read the **default** Executive Summary and the **4R** cycle (Listen → Care → Weave → Steward).
2. If adopting, skim **Implementation Kit** and **Timeline**.
3. For evaluation or funding, open **overdrive**/**public_debug** for GOI items and power scaffold.
