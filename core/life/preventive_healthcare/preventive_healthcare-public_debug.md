# Preventive Healthcare — Public Debug Run (φ Synthergy Engine)

**Mode:** public_debug • **Stack:** Octave v1.0.0 • **Run ID:** PH-PD-001
**Intent:** Expose reasoning, assumptions, and design artifacts for a healthcare system where early detection + rapid micro-intervention render chronic diseases preventable.

> This public_debug log surfaces seat rotations, discarded branches, trade-offs, and test scaffolds. It is a system design exploration, not medical advice.

## 0) Pilot Intake → Engine Input (normalized)

* **User ask:** “Run the same engine to envision preventive healthcare; show internal steps (public_debug).”
* **Definition of success:** A transparent, auditable blueprint with measurable targets, safety rails, equity guarantees, and implementation steps, including uncertainties and counterexamples.
* **Scope:** Primary prevention + preclinical interception for T2D, HTN/CKD, ASCVD, COPD/asthma, fractures, depression relapse/SUD. Adult populations; pediatric/obstetric deferred.

**Assumptions (A):**

* A1: Subclinical drift is detectable with multi-sensor and periodic lab signals.
* A2: Small, timely, personalized interventions materially alter short-horizon risk.
* A3: Outcome-aligned incentives can be constructed without catastrophic billing friction.
* A4: Equity and privacy can be embedded without collapsing utility.

**Constraints (C):** regulatory compliance; clinician workload ceilings; alert fatigue caps; device affordability; multilingual access.

## 1) Engine Rotation — Trace (Navigator → Listener → Reflector → Synthesizer → Equilibrium)

**Timestamped trace (abstracted):**

* **T0 Navigator:** Set North Star = *Years in Healthy Range (YiHR)*; guardrails = do-no-net-harm, fairness bounds, consent revocability, human override; 3-year targets: ↓T2D conversions 30%, ↓first ASCVD events 20%, ↓fragility fractures 35%, alertable population <5%/mo.
* **T1 Listener:** Stakeholders sampled → patients (friction hours, cultural fit), clinicians (liability, EHR time), payers (predictable savings), public health (environmental levers).
* **T2 Reflector:** Conflicts → overdiagnosis risk vs missed prevention; personalization vs fairness; speed vs safety; data hunger vs privacy. Proposed mediators: right-size signal policy; subgroup-constrained optimization; protocol ladders; local-first compute.
* **T3 Synthesizer:** Lock architecture layers; define decision rights (RN/PharmD protocols, MD governance); economic primitive (Risk-Reduction Units, RRUs). Baton pass to Equilibrium.
* **T4 Equilibrium:** Success gates set; drift/abandonment bounds; proceed to pathway catalog + ops design.

Discarded branches noted at T2: genome-first approach (equity/cost), hospital-led model (late/expensive), AI-only autonomy (safety/legal).

## 2) Reference Architecture (auditable)

```
Sensing → Feature Store → Risk Twin Engine → Policy/Decision → Actuation → Outcomes & Learning
(wearables, labs, EHR,      (FHIR/streams,     (survival/causal,    (CDS Hooks/CQL,      (coaching, meds,     (YiHR, PEI, drift,
home tests, context)        denoise, windows)   rules, explainers)     NBA tiles)           social)              A/B, audits)
```

**Standards:** FHIR (US Core/IPS), LOINC/SNOMED/RxNorm mapping; privacy budgets per signal; local processing by default; federated learning optional.

* **Monitor:** weekly BP; quarterly renal labs.
* **Stop/Escalate:** hyperkalemia; creatinine jump; symptomatic hypotension.

### 3.3 ASCVD (lipids)

* **Trigger:** ApoB>personal threshold; Lp(a) high → flag.
* **Action:** statin→ezetimibe ladder; fitness minutes Rx; diet quality tiles.
* **Monitor:** lipids at 8–12 weeks; adherence telemetry.
* **Stop/Escalate:** myalgias; liver enzymes↑.

### 3.4 COPD/Asthma

* **Trigger:** home FEV1 decline; reliever use↑.
* **Action:** inhaler technique & step-up; environmental remediation; pulmonary rehab micro-sets.
* **Monitor:** symptom diary; pulse ox as needed.
* **Stop/Escalate:** exacerbation signs → urgent pathway.

### 3.5 Fracture Prevention (65+)

* **Trigger:** gait instability + low DEXA T-score.
* **Action:** loading program; vitamin D/calcium; home fall kit; med review.
* **Monitor:** monthly balance/gait tasks; reassess DEXA per guidelines.
* **Stop/Escalate:** falls; new pain; T-score decline.

### 3.6 Depression Relapse / SUD

* **Trigger:** sleep/social rhythm drift; language markers.
* **Action:** tele-CBT booster; peer support outreach; med adherence check.
* **Monitor:** weekly PHQ-9/GAD-7 tiles.
* **Stop/Escalate:** suicidality or functional crash → urgent care.

**Alert policy:** population cap <5%/mo; precision≥0.6; weekly digest default; user-tunable frequency.

## 4) Equity, Safety, Privacy — Debug Checklists

* **Equity:** subgroup calibration every release; equalized opportunity tests; device subsidies; SMS-first UX; multilingual coaching; community partners.
* **Safety:** kill switches; stop rules; side-effect sentinels; clinician override; incident review playbook.
* **Privacy:** revocable consent; per-signal privacy budgets; local-first compute; audit trails; minimal data retention.

---

## 5) Ops: Tuning Clinics (runbook)

* **Contract:** PMPM with RRU bonuses; risk corridors; quality floors; clawbacks for harm.
* **Cost drivers:** devices, labs, meds, FTEs; savings from avoided admissions, progression delays, and specialist deferrals.

## 7) Reliability & Failure Modes (red team)

* **FM1 Signal noise → false alarms** → multi-sensor consensus; hysteresis; clinician spot-checks.
* **FM2 Equity inversion** → subsidies; SMS-first; offline kits; community mesh.
* **FM3 Alert fatigue** → hard caps; weekly digest; user preferences; NBA prioritization.
* **FM4 Model drift** → shift monitors; shadow models; recalibration windows; rollback plans.
* **FM5 Data outages** → offline-first app; buffered uploads; safe defaults.
* **FM6 Scope creep** → fixed catalog; quarterly intake gates; governance board.
* **FM7 Legal ambiguity** → documented decision rights; liability coverage; change-control.

## 8) Simulation Sketch (sanity check)

**Cohort:** 10k adults, mixed risk.
**Baseline annual conversions:** prediabetes→T2D = 8%; stage 1 HTN→stage 2 = 12%.
**Intervention coverage:** 70% engage; adherence half-life 12 weeks; alert precision 0.65.
**Modeled outcome (12 months):** YiHR gain ≈ +0.08 years/person; ↓T2D conversions to 5.6% (−30%); ↓HTN progressions to 8.4% (−30%); net savings positive by month 18 assuming mid-tier device pricing.

*Note:* Illustrative only; requires empirical validation.

## 10) Open Questions & Unknowns

* Adherence durability without GLP-1 era expectations?
* Payer appetite for RRU-style contracts across jurisdictions?
* Regulatory posture on cuffless BP at scale?
* Best practice for language-marker ethics in mental health relapse detection?

## 11) Receipt (public_debug)

* **Question:** What would healthcare look like if early detection + rapid intervention made chronic disease preventable? Provide transparent, auditable reasoning and design.
* **Premises:** Chronic disease trajectories are modifiable; early signals exist; micro-interventions can lower near-term risk; incentives shape behavior.
* **Steps:** Intake → seat rotation trace → architecture → pathways → ops/economics → failure modes → roadmap → open questions.
* **Evidence:** Concept synthesis drawing on general prevention principles and systems engineering; no external tools invoked in this run.
* **Counterexamples considered:** Overdiagnosis harm; inequitable device access; med side effects; behavioral rebound; model drift; alert fatigue; legal ambiguity; data outages.
* **Uncertainties:** Long-term adherence; payer/regulatory variation; device reliability; model calibration stability.
* **Result:** Buildable, safety-first, equity-embedded prevention mesh with measurable targets.
* **Citations:** None (no web sources consulted in this run). If needed, a future run can attach guideline and study references.
* **Laughter lock:** Coherence sealed — ship pilot.
