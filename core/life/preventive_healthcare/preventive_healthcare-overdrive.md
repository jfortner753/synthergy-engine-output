# Preventive Healthcare — Overdrive Mode (φ Synthergy Engine)

**Status:** overdrive • **Stack:** Octave v1.0.0 • **Run ID:** PH-OD-001
**Intent:** Re-architect healthcare so early detection + rapid micro-intervention make most chronic diseases preventable rather than inevitable.

---

## 0) Pilot Intake → Engine Input

* **Original ask (normalized):** “Project the healthcare system when early detection and rapid intervention shift chronic diseases from inevitability to preventability; produce a concrete, buildable blueprint.”
* **Key premises (validated):**

  1. Majority of high-burden chronic diseases have modifiable risk trajectories.
  2. Continuous/periodic sensing and labs can detect preclinical drift.
  3. Structured micro-interventions can reduce risk if delivered quickly and consistently.
  4. Incentives must reward risk reduction, not throughput.
* **Constraints:** equity-by-design, privacy-by-default, clinical safety nets, low-friction UX, payer realism.

---

## 1) Engine Rotation (Overdrive)

### A) Navigator (goal/guardrails)

* **North star:** Maximize *Years in Healthy Range (YiHR)* per capita.
* **Guardrails:** Do no net harm; alert-fatigue ceiling; algorithmic fairness; reversible consent; human override.
* **Targets (3-year):**

  * 30% reduction in conversions: prediabetes→T2D; stage 1 HTN→stage 2.
  * 20% reduction in first ASCVD events for high-risk cohort.
  * 35% reduction in fragility fractures in 65+.
  * <5% monthly alertable population; >80% user trust score.

### B) Listener (stakeholder field)

* **Patients:** clarity, minimal time tax, culturally matched coaching, transparent risk stories.
* **Clinicians:** fewer escalations, protocolized meds titration, clear liability boundaries, EHR-native workflows.
* **Payers/Employers:** predictable savings, verifiable avoided events, up-front risk corridors.
* **Public Health/Community:** food environment alignment, air quality, movement-friendly design.

### C) Reflector (tensions, trade-offs)

* Overdiagnosis vs. missed prevention → *Right-size the signal* policy.
* Personalization vs. fairness → subgroup-constrained optimization.
* Speed vs. safety → protocol ladders with stop rules + clinician checkpoints.
* Data hunger vs. privacy → local-first compute + privacy budgets.

### D) Synthesizer (system design)

* **Architecture** (see §2) to render Navigator goals into operational pathways.
* **Decision rights:** PharmD- and RN-led protocols with MD governance.
* **Economic layer:** Risk-reduction contracts indexed to YiHR + Prevented Events.

### E) Equilibrium (success criteria)

* Green if: YiHR↑, events↓, friction hours↓, equity deltas≤threshold, clinician load stable.
* Red if: alert precision<0.6, abandonment>15%, subgroup harm>pre-specified bound.

## 2) Reference Architecture (buildable)

```
Sensing Layer  →  Feature Store  →  Risk Twin Engine  →  Policy/Decision Layer  →  Actuation Layer  →  Outcomes & Learning
(wearables, labs,  (FHIR, streams)    (survival, causal,     (CDS Hooks, CQL,         (coaching, meds,        (metrics, audits,
home tests, EHR)                    Bayesian, rules)      dose titration)          social services)        drift, A/B)
```

### 2.1 Sensing Layer

* **Vitals & physiology:** HR/HRV, BP (cuff/cuffless), SpO₂, sleep, activity, gait.
* **Biomarkers (home & lab):** HbA1c, fasting glucose/OGTT, ApoB, eGFR/ACR, hs-CRP, lipids, vit D/B12/iron, thyroid panel.
* **Pulmonary:** home spirometry, rescue-inhaler telemetry.
* **Bone/mobility:** phone gait stability, DEXA.
* **Context:** meds, SDOH, environment (air quality, food access), calendar stressors.
* **Standards:** Device→FHIR Observation; codes via LOINC/SNOMED/RxNorm.

### 2.2 Feature Store & Risk Twin Engine

* **Feature store:** time-aligned, denoised, unit-harmonized; sliding windows (7/30/90 days).
* **Models:**

  * Short-horizon conversion risk (e.g., discrete-time survival).
  * Causal effect estimators for intervention choice (uplift models).
  * Calibration monitored per subgroup; online updating with drift alarms.
* **Explanations:** counterfactual levers (“what if 2× protein breakfast?”) with uncertainty bands.

### 2.3 Decision Layer (Safety-first)

* **Policy stack:**

  1. **Rules floor:** guideline-anchored thresholds (e.g., ApoB>threshold → statin/ezetimibe protocol).
  2. **Model middle:** individualized risk deltas and prioritization.
  3. **Human ceiling:** clinician sign-off for escalations or edge cases.
* **Execution:** FHIR CDS Hooks into EHR; patient-facing “Next Best Action (NBA)” tiles.
* **Stop rules:** auto-pauses for side effects, life events, pregnancy, or signal anomalies.

### 2.4 Actuation Layer

* **Micro-interventions:**

  * Food timing & swaps, resistance “micro-sets,” sleep consolidation.
  * Pharmacist titration under standing orders (statins, ACE-I/ARBs, thiazides, metformin/acarbose, inhalers).
  * Remote PT/CBT boosters; community services (food boxes, smoking cessation, housing referral).
* **Cadence:** weekly light-touch; monthly labs if elevated risk; quarterly reassess.

### 2.5 Learning & Audit

* **Metrics bus:** YiHR, Risk-Adjusted Progression-Free Months (rPFM), Prevented-Event Index (PEI), Alert Precision/Recall, Friction Hours, Equity Δ.
* **Governance:** model cards, shift reports, incident reviews, rollback plans, kill switches.

## 3) Pathway Catalog (triggers → actions → monitoring → stop)

* **6–18 months:** expand to ASCVD + depression relapse; add community mesh (food/air/walkability); launch risk contracts.
* **18–36 months:** COPD/asthma + fracture pathways; federated learning; scale to 50–100k lives; external validation.
* **36–60 months:** region-wide mesh; continuous A/B; workforce credentialing; publish playbooks.

---

## 9) Failure Modes & Mitigations (red team)

* **FM1 Signal noise → false alarms** → multi-sensor consensus + hysteresis + clinician spot-checks.
* **FM2 Equity inversion** (benefits accrue to digitally rich) → device subsidies, SMS-first, community partners.
* **FM3 Alert fatigue** → hard caps, precision targets, weekly digest, user preferences.
* **FM4 Model drift** → shift monitors, shadow models, periodic recalibration.
* **FM5 Data outages** → offline-first app, buffered uploads, safe defaults.
* **FM6 Scope creep** → strict condition catalog, quarterly gatekeeping.
* **FM7 Legal ambiguity** → clear decision rights, documentation, liability cover.
