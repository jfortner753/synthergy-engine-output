# Preventive Healthcare Blueprints (φ Synthergy Engine)

Three views of the same concept: **early detection + rapid micro‑intervention** to make most chronic diseases *preventable*, not inevitable.

## Files

* **[preventive_healthcare-default.md](./preventive_healthcare-default.md)** — Plain‑language overview of the target system. Covers ambient detection, personal risk twins, micro‑interventions, incentives, and equity/safety guardrails. *Audience:* strategy & general readers.
* **[preventive_healthcare-overdrive.md](./preventive_healthcare-overdrive.md)** — Buildable blueprint. Includes reference architecture, pathway catalog, ops design for “tuning clinics,” economics/contracts, KPIs, roadmap, and failure‑mode mitigations. *Audience:* product, clinical ops, data/engineering.
* **[preventive_healthcare-public_debug.md](./preventive_healthcare-public_debug.md)** — Transparent reasoning log. Shows intake normalization, seat rotations, trade‑offs, discarded branches, simulation sketch, and open questions. *Audience:* reviewers, compliance, research.

## How to use

1. **Start with the default** to understand the end‑state.
2. **Dive into overdrive** for implementation details.
3. **Review public_debug** for assumptions, risks, and open questions.
