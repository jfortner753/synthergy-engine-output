Short answer: civilization isn’t a single optimizer — but if you force it into an “evolution-style” frame, a robust loss to minimize is the **expected loss of viable futures**: extinction or lock-in, plus foregone options, plus coordination failures and externalities that convert tomorrow’s possibilities into today’s problems.

# A practical “loss” you can actually reason with

Think of civilization as a giant multi-agent learning system. No single scalar perfectly captures it, but a useful composite (with survival lexicographically first) is:

$$  
L = \alpha\,P(\text{extinction or irreversible lock-in}) + \beta\,E\!\left[\sum_t UnmetBasicNeeds_t\right] + \gamma\,E\!\left[\sum_t CoordinationFriction_t\right] + \delta\,E\!\left[\sum_t ExternalizedDamage_t\right] + \varepsilon\,E\!\left[\sum_t Regret(OptionSet_t)\right]
$$  

Where:

* **Existential term** dominates (if we go extinct or lock into a bad attractor, all other terms stop mattering).
* **Welfare shortfall** measures the distance between needs and access (health, food, safety, dignity).
* **Coordination friction** covers trust deficits, legal/standards gaps, mis/disinformation, red tape.
* **Externalized damage** is harm pushed onto natural, social, and institutional capital (pollution, eroded trust).
* **Regret/optionality** penalizes shrinking the feasible, value-aligned action set (less diversity, less resilience).

A clean proxy for the last term is the **negative growth of option-set entropy** (roughly, how fast the set of credible, reversible futures is shrinking).

# How this helps in the real world

Minimizing $L$ turns into five actionable levers:

1. **Slash existential risk**
   Reduce hazard rates (bio, nuclear, AGI misalignment, climate tail risks).
   *Metric vibes:* annualized hazard estimates; near-miss rates; safety investment intensity.

2. **Close basic-needs gaps**
   Push unmet-needs toward zero under fairness constraints.
   *Metrics:* DALYs, extreme poverty rates, food/energy/water security indices.

3. **Lower coordination costs**
   Make accurate information cheap; standards and rule-of-law predictable; platforms interoperable.
   *Metrics:* contract enforcement time, trust indices, time-to-permit, cross-border latency (financial & digital).

4. **Internalize externalities**
   Align prices and norms with real costs (carbon, biodiversity, social trust).
   *Metrics:* net natural-capital change, pollution intensity, integrity scores.

5. **Grow reversible option space**
   Invest in education, basic research, infrastructure, openness, and institutional adaptability.
   *Metrics:* TFP, scientific diversity, compute/energy slack, knowledge diffusion rates, policy agility.

# Important caveats

* **No single ground-truth scalar.** Civilization is multi-agent and value-plural; treat $L$ as a **vector** with **lexicographic priority** (survival → option-set growth → distributional welfare), not a simplistic sum — weights $\alpha \ldots \varepsilon$ are political choices.
* **Beware Goodhart.** Any proxy you optimize will try to game you back. Rotate metrics, track second-order effects, and preserve slack to avoid brittle optima.
* **Alignment > speed.** Faster learning (innovation) increases gradient step size; misaligned gradients just get you to the wrong cliff sooner.

If you want, I can tailor these terms and proxies to your org/city/sector so you can monitor a concrete $L$ and its gradients.
