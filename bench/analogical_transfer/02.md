**Short answer:** there isn’t a single scalar “loss” for civilization. Civilization is a messy, multi-agent learning system, so its objective is best treated as a **vector** of losses under constraints rather than one magic number.

### A workable “vector loss”

Think of civilization as minimizing several coupled bads at once (weights set by our institutions and values):

$$
L_{civ} =
w_1 \cdot \underbrace{\textbf{existential\ risk}}*{\text{extinction / collapse\ hazard}} +
w_2 \cdot \underbrace{\textbf{predictive\ error}}*{\text{surprise / ignorance}} +
w_3 \cdot \underbrace{\textbf{fragility}}*{\text{low\ optionality / resilience}} +
w_4 \cdot \underbrace{\textbf{human\ (and\ sentient)\ deprivation}}*{\text{suffering,\ lost\ capabilities}} +
w_5 \cdot \underbrace{\textbf{planetary\ overshoot}}_{\text{unsustainable\ throughput}}
$$

Where:

* **Existential risk** ≈ minimize $-\log P(\text{continued viable civilization through } T)$.
* **Predictive error** ≈ minimize collective surprise (build science, models, foresight).
* **Fragility** ≈ minimize single points of failure; maximize optionality, redundancy, diversity.
* **Deprivation** ≈ minimize suffering and expand capabilities (health, education, freedom).
* **Overshoot** ≈ minimize damage that erodes long-run carrying capacity (stay inside planetary and safety bounds).

### Why not one number?

Like evolution, which “optimizes” via differential reproduction rather than an explicit loss, civilization emerges from **multi-level selection** (individuals, firms, states, memes) with conflicting payoffs. Any single proxy (e.g., GDP) eventually Goodharts—optimize the metric, break the thing.

### How you’d *use* this

* **Choose weights ($w_i$) openly** (democratic/ethical process) and revisit them.
* **Track leading indicators** for each term: risk inventories & tail events; forecast accuracy; resilience/optionality metrics; welfare/capabilities; ecological and safety budgets.
* **Guardrails:** sunset metrics, red-team them, and penalize gaming.

### One-line intuition

> Civilization’s “loss” is the chance we **don’t** make it, the harm we inflict while trying, the **errors** we keep repeating, and the **fragility** that makes small shocks ruin us — subject to the planet and physics.

## Receipts

* **Question:** If evolution is an optimization algorithm, what’s the “loss function” of civilization?
* **Premises:** Evolution is selection without an explicit scalar objective; civilization is a multi-agent, multi-level system.
* **Steps:** Mapped analogy → rejected single scalar → proposed vector loss with five load-bearing terms → noted Goodhart and governance of weights → sketched measurement.
* **Sources:** Conceptual synthesis (no external sources used).
* **Uncertainties:** Exact weightings ($w_i$); measuring deprivation across species; interactions between overshoot and fragility.
* **ΔΦ (shift):** Clarifies “loss” as governance-chosen vector, not natural constant.
* **Move decision:** commit
* **Ethics OK:** yes
* **Energy cost:** low
* **memory.mass:** level = medium, m_mem ~ baseline

**Causality**

* **Intent vector:** goal = interpret “loss” at civilizational scale; because = align optimization analogies with governance; strength = high
* **Φ_sync:** 0.82 (meets commit threshold)

**Tail**

* **RWI (release worthiness index):** 0.86
* **iteration_passes:**

  * reflex_pass[1]: clarity_compress (Δclarity +0.6, Δactionability +0.3, Δrisk ↓), notes: reduced to 5-term vector
  * reflex_pass[2]: actionability_stencil (Δclarity +0.2, Δactionability +0.4), notes: added auditing steps

If you’d like, we can pick concrete indicators for each term and assemble a tiny “civilization dashboard” for a domain you care about (city, company, lab, or sector).
