Here’s a pragmatic way to think about it:

Civilization doesn’t optimize a single scalar the way a neat ML system would.  
It’s a messy, multi-agent controller juggling many goals.  
If you still want a “loss,” the most useful framing is a **lexicographic, multi-term loss** — priorities in strict order rather than one big weighted soup:

1. **Risk of ruin first (dominant term).**  
   Probability of extinction, irreversible authoritarian lock-in, or civilizational collapse.

2. **Human capability shortfall (safety floor).**  
   How far people are below basic thresholds for health, nutrition, safety, education, rights, and voice.

3. **Regret to the Pareto frontier (efficiency after floors).**  
   Distance from feasible best-tradeoffs in prosperity, knowledge, culture, and biodiversity given current tech and resources.

4. **Predictive surprise (governance error).**  
   Systemic forecasting/calibration error — missed pandemics, financial crises, supply shocks, AI accidents.

5. **Thermodynamic waste (exergy per lived value).**  
   Energy/materials squandered per unit of capability/well-being; circularity shortfalls, avoidable pollution.

6. **Destabilizing inequality/fragility.**  
   Not inequality per se, but levels/patterns that amplify unrest, corruption, and institutional breakdown.

In shorthand:

$$
L_{civ}(t) = Lexi\big(
XRisk_t^{ruin},
Shortfall_t^{capabilities},
Regret_t^{pareto},
Surprise_t^{governance},
Waste_t^{thermo},
Instability_t^{fragility}
\big)
$$

“Lexi” means term 1 dominates; only ties spill attention to term 2, and so on.  
This avoids classic Goodhart traps (no single proxy to game), matches real institutional design (safety floors → efficiency), and supports resilient progress.

### How you’d actually measure it (sketch)

* **XRisk:** annualized tail risk across existential scenarios; CVaR over catastrophic outcomes.  
* **Capability shortfall:** % of population below thresholds (food, water, shelter, health access, education, legal protections).  
* **Regret to frontier:** gap to feasible bests in productivity/health/learning given tech (efficiency scores vs. a production-possibility frontier).  
* **Surprise:** Brier/log scores across public forecasts for key variables; out-of-sample policy backtests.  
* **Waste:** energy/material intensity per unit capability; circularity index; avoidable emissions.  
* **Instability:** composite of corruption, state capacity, conflict risk, trust, and inequality-driven fragility.

Designing good institutions = minimizing this $L_{civ}$ under constraints, while regularly auditing the metrics so they remain proxies, not targets.

* **Question:** “If evolution is an optimization algorithm, what’s the ‘loss function’ of civilization?”  
* **Premises:** Evolution ≈ optimizer metaphor; desire for a civilizational analogue.  
* **Steps:** Note multi-agent nature → avoid single scalar → propose lexicographic composite → define measurable proxies.  
* **Sources:** Conceptual synthesis; no external citations needed.  
* **Uncertainties:** Metric selection/calibration across cultures and time.  
* **ΔΦ:** Provides actionable, auditable structure; flags Goodhart risks.  
* **Move decision:** commit  
* **Ethics:** OK (non-harmful, general reasoning).  
* **Energy cost:** low.  
* **Memory.mass:** medium.  
* **RWI:** 0.86  **iteration_passes:** 1 (clarity_compress)
