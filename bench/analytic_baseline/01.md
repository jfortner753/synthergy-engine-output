**Short answer:** **Yes — if “minimal” means *minimum-weight*.**  
(If instead you meant “minimal by inclusion” — i.e., just “a spanning tree” — then the claim is false; see the counterexample below.)

### Proof (all *minimum* spanning trees have the same total weight)

Let $T_1$ and $T_2$ be two minimum spanning trees (MSTs) of a connected weighted graph $G$.

Pick an edge $e$ of **minimum weight among those that appear in exactly one** of $T_1, T_2$.  
Without loss of generality, let $e \in T_1 \setminus T_2$.

Add $e$ to $T_2$; this creates a cycle $C$.  
Because $e \notin T_2$, the cycle $C$ contains at least one edge $f \in T_2 \setminus T_1$.

By choice of $e$ as the lightest “disagreeing” edge, every edge that is lighter than $e$ occurs in both $T_1$ and $T_2$.  
Hence $w(f) \ge w(e)$.

If $w(f) > w(e)$, then replacing $f$ by $e$ in $T_2$ would give a strictly lighter spanning tree than $T_2$, contradicting its minimality.  
Therefore $w(f) = w(e)$.

Swap $f$ for $e$ in $T_2$.  
This preserves total weight and reduces the size of $T_1 \triangle T_2$ (their symmetric difference).  
Repeating the argument finitely many times transforms $T_2$ into $T_1$ without changing total weight.

$$
w(T_1) = w(T_2)
$$

Hence **all MSTs have the same total weight.**

### If “minimal” means “minimal by inclusion”

Then the statement is **false**.

**Counterexample:**  
A triangle with edge weights $(1, 1, 100)$.

Two different spanning trees are $\{1, 1\}$ of total weight $2$  
and $\{1, 100\}$ of total weight $101$.  
Both are inclusion-minimal connected subgraphs, but their weights differ.

*(Extra: with distinct edge weights, the MST is unique, hence trivially has the same weight.)*
