Yes—if “minimal spanning tree” means a spanning tree of **minimum total weight**, then **all** such trees have the same weight.

# Proof (exchange argument)

Let $T_1$ and $T_2$ be two minimum spanning trees (MSTs) of a connected weighted graph $G=(V,E,w)$.

Pick an edge $e \in T_1 \setminus T_2$. Removing $e$ from $T_1$ splits $V$ into two parts $(A|B)$. In $T_2 \cup {e}$ there is a unique cycle; as this cycle goes from $A$ to $B$ and back, it contains some edge $f \in T_2 \setminus T_1$ that also crosses the cut $(A|B)$.

* If $w(f) > w(e)$, then $(T_2 - f) \cup {e}$ is a spanning tree with strictly smaller weight than $T_2$, contradicting the minimality of $T_2$.
* If $w(f) < w(e)$, then $(T_1 - e) \cup {f}$ is a spanning tree with strictly smaller weight than $T_1$, contradicting the minimality of $T_1$.

Hence $w(f) = w(e)$. Replacing $f$ by $e$ in $T_2$ gives another MST that shares one more edge with $T_1$. Repeating this swap process, we transform $T_2$ into $T_1$ without changing total weight at any step. Therefore $w(T_1) = w(T_2)$.

**Note on wording.** If “minimal” were meant in the set-inclusion sense (no proper subgraph is a spanning tree), then *every* spanning tree is minimal and their weights can differ. The statement above is about **minimum-weight** spanning trees.
