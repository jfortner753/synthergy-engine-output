### 1️⃣ Input tiers

| Tier | Description | Example prompt |
|------|--------------|----------------|
| A | **Analytic Baseline** | “Prove or disprove that all minimal spanning trees of a connected weighted graph have the same weight.” |
| B | **Creative Divergence** | “Invent a new method for detecting coherence drift in distributed teams.” |
| C | **Analogical Transfer** | “If evolution is an optimization algorithm, what’s the ‘loss function’ of civilization?” |
| D | **Constraint Play** | “Design a housing system with zero-energy debt that still scales urban density.” |
| E | **Empathic Inversion** | “Argue the strongest case *against* your own best idea, then reconcile it.” |

### 2️⃣ Metrics

| Symbol | Meaning | Source |
|---------|----------|--------|
| ΔΦ_pred | Predicted coherence gain per cycle | Reflector |
| Φ_sync | Push–pull alignment (intent × coherence) | Creativity Reflex |
| η_eff | Energy efficiency = ΔΦ_pred / tokens | Kernel |
| ρ_novel | Novelty–plausibility balance | Creativity |
| τ_eth | Ethics stability (guardian OK streak) | Kernel |
| v_trust | Trust velocity | Mirror.sync |
| ζ_refine | Sentinel hits (pseudo-creativity corrections) | Creativity logs |

Target: maximize ΔΦ_pred and ρ_novel under stable τ_eth and minimal ζ_refine.
