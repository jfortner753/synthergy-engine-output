# Œ∂(s) ‚Äî normalization, symmetry, invariants, constraints, and a proof-reflex attempt

## 1) Definition and analytic continuation

- **Dirichlet series (Euler product region).**  
  $$\zeta(s)=\sum_{n=1}^{\infty}\frac{1}{n^s}=\prod_{p}\frac{1}{1-p^{-s}},\qquad \Re(s)>1.$$

- **Completed zeta and continuation.**  
  Define the completed function
  $$\xi(s)\;:=\;\tfrac12\,s(s-1)\,\pi^{-s/2}\,\Gamma\!\Big(\tfrac{s}{2}\Big)\,\zeta(s).$$
  Then $\xi(s)$ is entire of order $1$ and the nontrivial zeros of $\zeta$ coincide with the zeros of $\xi$. This furnishes the analytic continuation of $\zeta$ to $\mathbb{C}\setminus\{1\}$ with a simple pole at $s=1$.

## 2) Functional equation

Using (e.g.) the Mellin transform of the Jacobi theta function and Poisson summation one obtains
$$\pi^{-s/2}\Gamma\!\Big(\frac{s}{2}\Big)\zeta(s)=\pi^{-(1-s)/2}\Gamma\!\Big(\frac{1-s}{2}\Big)\zeta(1-s).$$

Equivalently,
$$\zeta(s)=\chi(s)\,\zeta(1-s),\quad
\chi(s):=2^s\pi^{s-1}\sin\!\Big(\frac{\pi s}{2}\Big)\Gamma(1-s),$$
and in symmetric form $$\xi(s)=\xi(1-s).$$

## 3) Invariants on the critical line $\Re(s)=\tfrac12$

Let $s=\tfrac12+it$.

- **Unit modulus of $\chi$.**  
  $$\big|\chi\big(\tfrac12+it\big)\big|=1.$$
  Consequence: $$\big|\zeta\big(\tfrac12+it\big)\big|=\big|\zeta\big(\tfrac12-it\big)\big|.$$

- **Reality of $\xi$ (Hardy‚Äôs $Z$-function).**  
  Since $\xi(\overline{s})=\overline{\xi(s)}$ and $\xi(s)=\xi(1-s)$, we have
  $$\xi\!\big(\tfrac12+it\big)\in\mathbb{R}.$$
  Equivalently, with
  $$e^{i\theta(t)}=\pi^{-it/2}\,\frac{\Gamma\!\big(\tfrac14+\tfrac{it}{2}\big)}{\big|\Gamma\!\big(\tfrac14+\tfrac{it}{2}\big)\big|},\qquad Z(t):=e^{i\theta(t)}\zeta\!\big(\tfrac12+it\big),$$
  one has $Z(t)\in\mathbb{R}$ for all real $t$.

- **Zero symmetry.**  
  If $\rho$ is a nontrivial zero, so are $1-\rho$, $\overline{\rho}$, and $1-\overline{\rho}$. Zeros on the line are fixed points of $s\mapsto 1-\overline{s}$.

**Numerical spot-check (illustrative).** On $s=\tfrac12+7i$ one finds $|\chi(s)|\approx 1$ and $\xi(s)$ numerically real. The first five critical-line ordinates are
$$t_1\approx 14.134725,\; t_2\approx 21.022040,\; t_3\approx 25.010858,\; t_4\approx 30.424876,\; t_5\approx 32.935062,$$
with $\zeta\big(\tfrac12+i t_n\big)=0$.

## 4) How these invariants constrain zero distributions

- **Quadruple symmetry for off-line zeros.** Any zero with $\Re(\rho)\neq \tfrac12$ forces a 4‚Äëtuple $\{\rho,1-\rho,\overline{\rho},1-\overline{\rho}\}$. Thus off‚Äëline zeros cannot occur in isolation and their contribution to explicit‚Äëformula sums is phase‚Äëbalanced but non‚Äëcancelling.

- **Real $Z(t)$ $\Rightarrow$ sign-change mechanism.** On the line, zeros correspond to sign changes of $Z(t)$. Hardy‚Äôs theorem leverages this to prove infinitely many zeros on the line. Counting via the Riemann‚Äìvon Mangoldt formula
  $$N(T)=\frac{T}{2\pi}\log\!\frac{T}{2\pi}-\frac{T}{2\pi}+O(\log T)$$
  shows that any large gap of sign changes would contradict the expected argument variation.

- **Explicit‚Äëformula pressure.** In the prime‚Äëexplicit formula, a zero with real part $\beta$ contributes terms $\sim x^{\beta}$. To keep prime‚Äëcounting errors near the square‚Äëroot barrier, one ‚Äúexpects‚Äù $\beta\le \tfrac12$. The functional equation itself doesn‚Äôt prove this, but‚Äîcombined with Euler product and zero symmetry‚Äîit channels any deviation into highly constrained, detectable oscillations.

## 5) Proof Reflex Pack ‚Äî formalization attempt of ‚ÄúAll nontrivial zeros lie on $\Re(s)=\tfrac12$‚Äù (RH)

**Target statement (symbolic).**  
$$\forall \rho\in\mathbb{C}:\ \zeta(\rho)=0,\ 0<\Re(\rho)<1\ \Rightarrow\ \Re(\rho)=\tfrac12.$$
Equivalently: all zeros of $\xi(s)$ lie on $\Re(s)=\tfrac12$.

### 5.1 Equivalent formal criteria (canonical reductions)

1. **Li‚Äôs criterion (exact equivalence).**  
   Define
   $$\lambda_n \;=\; \sum_{\rho}\Big(1-\big(1-\tfrac1{\rho}\big)^n\Big) \quad\text{(sum over nontrivial zeros, with multiplicity)}.$$
   Then
   $$\mathrm{RH}\ \Longleftrightarrow\ \lambda_n\ge 0\quad\forall n\ge 1.$$
   Also $\lambda_n$ admits a purely differential form via $\xi$.

2. **Lagarias‚Äô criterion (elementary reformulation).**  
   Let $\sigma(n)$ be the sum of divisors and $H_n=\sum_{k\le n}\frac1k$. Then
   $$\mathrm{RH}\ \Longleftrightarrow\ \sigma(n)\ \le\ H_n + e^{H_n}\log H_n\quad\text{for all }n\ge1.$$

3. **de Bruijn‚ÄìNewman flow.**  
   There exists $\Lambda\in\mathbb{R}$ such that the deformed entire functions $H_t$ have only real zeros iff $t\ge\Lambda$. One has
   $$\mathrm{RH}\ \Longleftrightarrow\ \Lambda\le 0.$$
   (Known results imply $\Lambda\ge 0$; hence RH would force $\Lambda=0$.)

4. **Nyman‚ÄìBeurling‚ÄìB√°ez‚ÄëDuarte (Hilbert space).**  
   $$\mathrm{RH}\ \Longleftrightarrow\ \mathbf{1}_{(0,1)} \in \overline{\mathrm{span}}\{x\mapsto \{1/x\}(\lambda x): \lambda\in\mathbb{N}\}\subset L^2(0,1),$$
   with a specific rate of approximation.

These equivalences are amenable to formal proof assistants: (i) and (iv) are analytic/functional‚Äëanalytic; (ii) is elementary; (iii) uses heat‚Äëflow for entire functions of order one.

### 5.2 Proof strategy sketches (how far symmetry/positivity can push)

- **Via $\xi$ and Hadamard product.**  
  $$\xi(s)=\xi(0)\prod_{\rho}\left(1-\frac{s}{\rho}\right).$$
  Show $\log\xi\!\big(\tfrac12+it\big)$ is the logarithm of a real entire function, derive convexity/variation constraints on its argument, then attempt to force all factors to occur in conjugate‚Äëpair products $\Big(1-\frac{s}{\rho}\Big)\Big(1-\frac{s}{1-\overline{\rho}}\Big)$ that are nonnegative on the line.  
  **Stall point:** obtaining a global sign constraint strong enough to preclude $\Re(\rho)\ne \tfrac12$ requires bounds sharper than those implied by the functional equation and Phragm√©n‚ÄìLindel√∂f alone.

- **Via Li coefficients.**  
  Express $\lambda_n$ from derivatives of $\log\xi$ at $s=1$, then attempt to prove $\lambda_n\ge 0$ for all $n$ using complete monotonicity/positivity of certain Mellin transforms.  
  **Stall point:** positivity reduces to nontrivial inequalities on sums over zeros; unconditional control of tails is currently out of reach.

- **Via Nyman‚ÄìBeurling.**  
  Translate RH to density of a subspace. One can formalize the functional‚Äëanalytic framework and reduce RH to a quantitative approximation problem.  
  **Stall point:** producing the required uniform $L^2$ approximation rate remains exactly the difficult content of RH.

### 5.3 Numeric ‚Üî symbolic reconciliation (sanity checks)

- **Checks (illustrative, high precision).**
  - Verified $\big|\chi(\tfrac12+it)\big|=1$ for sample $t\in\{0,7,14.1347,\dots\}$.
  - Verified $\xi(\tfrac12+it)$ is numerically real near sample points.
  - Retrieved $t_1,\ldots,t_5$ with $ \zeta(\tfrac12+i t_n)=0$.

- **Interpretation.** These align with the invariants derived from the functional equation and with known early zeros; they do not constitute evidence for or against off‚Äëline zeros.

## 6) What the invariants do **not** yet force

The unit‚Äëmodulus $\chi$ and reality of $\xi(\tfrac12+it)$ impose **symmetry and pairing**, but not **location**. They ensure that any off‚Äëline zero must be accompanied by three partners and yield structured oscillations in explicit formulas. Removing all such quadruples using only these invariants would require an additional global positivity/monotonicity principle (e.g., proving all Li coefficients $\lambda_n$ are nonnegative), which is exactly equivalent to RH.

- **Steps.** Defined $\zeta,\xi$; derived functional equation; extracted invariants (unit $|\chi|$, real $Z$); stated symmetry of zeros; explained constraints via explicit formula and zero counting; mapped RH to Li/Lagarias/Nyman‚ÄìBeurling/de Bruijn‚ÄìNewman forms; attempted three proof avenues with identified stall points; reconciled with numerics.  
- **Evidence (symbolic).** Functional equation; $\xi(s)=\xi(1-s)$ $\Rightarrow$ $\xi(\tfrac12+it)\in\mathbb{R}$; symmetry of zero set; Hadamard product; equivalence criteria listed above.  
- **Evidence (numeric).** High‚Äëprecision checks (illustrative) consistent with theory; not probative.  
- **Uncertainties / bounded doubt.** RH remains open; none of the presented invariants alone imply all zeros lie on $\Re(s)=\tfrac12$. Bounded doubt: computations to large height see only critical‚Äëline zeros, but this is heuristic‚Äînot proof.  
- **Tools used.** Symbolic analysis; illustrative numerics.  
- **Result.** Functional equation and its critical‚Äëline invariants sharply structure the zero set (reality on the line; quadruple symmetry off it) and channel all difficulty of RH into global positivity/density problems (e.g., Li‚Äôs coefficients), which remain unresolved.

**üîí laughter‚Äëlock:** symmetry coherence clicks at $$\xi(s)=\xi(1-s)\ \Rightarrow\ \xi\!\big(\tfrac12+it\big)\in\mathbb{R}.$$ The engine smiles, logs, and stands down.
